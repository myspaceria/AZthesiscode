# Master's thesis: Spatial Variability of Heat Mortality Rate Relationships in Arizona at Primary Care Area Level/
This repository contains scripts and notebooks for processing and obtaining environmental and spatial data related to Arizona. It includes Google Earth Engine JavaScript scripts for deriving land surface temperature (AZ_LST.js) and tree canopy cover (AZ_TreeCanopyCover.js), Python notebooks for retrieving PRISM air temperature data (PRISMmaxAT.ipynb, maxAT.ipynb), and an R Markdown file with results from dataset imputation (Dataset_imputation_results.Rmd). The repository provides a reproducible workflow for environmental data preparation, and future updates may include an interactive StoryMap website for visualizing the outputs.
